     No man is an island,
     Entire of itself,
     Every man is a piece of the continent,
     A part of the main.
     If a clod be washed away by the sea,
     Europe is the less.
     As well as if a promontory were.
     As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
     Or of thine own were:
     Any man’s death diminishes me,
     Because I am involved in mankind,
     And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
     It tolls for thee.

     Whose woods these are I think I know.
     His house is in the village though;
     He will not see me stopping here
     To watch his woods fill up with snow.
     My little horse must think it queer
     To stop without a farmhouse near
     Between the woods and frozen lake
     The darkest evening of the year.
     He gives his harness bells a shake
     To ask if there is some mistake.
     The only other sound’s the sweep
     Of easy wind and downy flake.
     The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
     But I have promises to keep,
     And miles to go before I sleep,
     And miles to go before I sleep.

    You may write me down in history
    With your bitter, twisted lies,
    You may tread me in the very dirt
    But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
    Does my sassiness upset you?
    Why are you beset with gloom?
    ’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
    Pumping in my living room.
    Just like moons and like suns,
    With the certainty of tides,
    Just like hopes springing high,
    Still I’ll rise.
    Did you want to see me broken?
    Bowed head and lowered eyes?
    Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
    Weakened by my soulful cries.
    Does my haughtiness offend you?
    Don’t you take it awful hard
    ’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
    Diggin’ in my own back yard.
    You may shoot me with your words,
    You may cut me with your eyes,
    You may kill me with your hatefulness,
    But still, like air, I’ll rise.
    Does my sexiness upset you?
    Does it come as a surprise
    That I dance like I’ve got diamonds
    At the meeting of my thighs?
    Out of the huts of history’s shame
    I rise
    Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
    I rise
    I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
    Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
    Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
    I rise
    Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
    I rise
    Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
    I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
    I rise
    I rise
    I rise.

                          <img src="images/poem4.jpg" alt="This is a image" width="50%">
                          <pre>
    Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
    And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
    Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
    When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

                          <pre>
    There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,
    And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
    And frogs in the pools singing at night,
    And wild plum trees in tremulous white;
    Robins will wear their feathery fire,
    Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
    And not one will know of the war, not one
    Will care at last when it is done.
    Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,
    If mankind perished utterly;
    And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn
    Would scarcely know that we were gone.
